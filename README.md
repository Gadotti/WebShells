# WebShells
Web pages to control and get informations from the server
If you have access to the server to upload this file or you find a file inclusion vulnerability, a file like this will give free access to the server getting sensitive info, upload/change/delete/read files or establish a database connection.
 
A 'Web Shell' per definition, used to give shell access only, but why stop there? I built a page example with more shortcuts to demonstrate and study what is possible if someone can upload unrestricted files to the system.
 
PRs are welcome!
